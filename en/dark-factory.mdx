# Dark Factory

The flagship content production pipeline. Upload a single product image, select the services you need, and the Dark Factory generates everything automatically — product photos, videos, UGC-style ads, social content, and more — all in one coordinated run.

## What is Dark Factory?

Dark Factory is an automated AI content pipeline designed for e-commerce brands and marketers. Instead of running separate tools for images, videos, and ads, you define your content needs once and the system coordinates everything.

**The workflow:**
1. Upload your product image
2. Select services from the catalog (or apply a quick recipe)
3. Configure per-service settings
4. Review cost and execution plan
5. Launch and monitor progress
6. Download all assets from the results gallery
