# Node System

Build complex AI workflows with a visual drag-and-drop interface. Chain together 36 node types to create custom pipelines, automate repetitive tasks, and save workflows as templates.

**Access:** [app.wrldwide.ai/nodes](https://app.wrldwide.ai/nodes)

---

## Overview

The Node System is a visual workflow builder that lets you:

- **Chain AI Operations** — Connect image generation, video, upscaling, editing in sequence
- **Batch Processing** — Run workflows on multiple inputs simultaneously
- **Conditional Logic** — Use If/Else nodes for branching workflows
- **Save Templates** — Reuse successful workflows
- **Share Workflows** — Publish to Marketplace
- **Automate** — Schedule workflows with Cron nodes

---

## What Are Nodes?

Nodes are the building blocks of workflows. Each node performs a specific function — from generating an image to removing a background to upscaling a video. You connect nodes by dragging from an output port to an input port, creating a data flow that defines your pipeline.

**Key concepts:**
- **Nodes** — Individual processing units (36 types available)
- **Ports** — Input (left) and output (right) connection points
- **Edges** — Connections between nodes that define data flow
- **Canvas** — The workspace where you build workflows
- **Workspace** — A saved workflow project

## Example Workflows

### Basic: Generate + Upscale

```
[Prompt Node] → [Model Node] → [Upscale Node] → [Output]
```

**Use Case:** Generate images at 2K, upscale to 4K

---

### Product Video Pipeline

```
[Image Upload] → [Remove Background] → [Video Generate] → [Output]
```

**Use Case:** Convert product photos to clean videos

---

### Batch Processing

```
[List Node (10 prompts)] → [Model Node] → [Upscale] → [Bulk Export]
```

**Use Case:** Generate and upscale 10 images in parallel

---

### Conditional Workflow

```
[Image Upload] → [If/Else: Contains Person?]
               → YES → [Face Swap]
               → NO → [Background Removal]
               → [Merge] → [Export]
```

**Use Case:** Different processing based on image content

---

### Automated Content Creation

```
[Cron Schedule (Daily 9am)] → [Prompt Node] → [Model Node] → [Social Share]
```

**Use Case:** Automatically generate and post daily content

---

## Advanced Features

### Batch Processing with List Node

The **List Node** lets you process multiple items in parallel:

**Example:**
```
[List Node]
  - Input 1: "Red car"
  - Input 2: "Blue house"
  - Input 3: "Green tree"
  ↓
[Model Node] → Generates 3 images in parallel
```

**Benefits:**
- Faster than sequential processing
- More cost-efficient for bulk jobs
- Single credit charge for the batch

---

### Cron Scheduling

Automate workflows on schedule:

- **Daily:** Generate content every day at 9am
- **Weekly:** Create weekly summary videos
- **Hourly:** Monitor and process new uploads
- **Custom:** Any cron expression

**Example:**
```
[Cron Schedule: 0 9 * * *] → [Workflow]
```
(Runs daily at 9:00 AM)

---

### Conditional Logic with If/Else

Branch workflows based on conditions:

**Example:**
```
[Image Upload]
  ↓
[If/Else: Image contains face?]
  ├─ YES → [Face Swap Node]
  └─ NO → [Background Removal Node]
  ↓
[Merge]
  ↓
[Export]
```

    - Add descriptions for future reference
    - Comment complex logic
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Optimize for Cost">

    - Test with single items before batch processing
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Workflow won't run">
    - Check all required fields are filled (marked with *)
    - Verify all nodes are connected properly
    - Check for circular dependencies
    - Review error messages in console
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Node connection fails">
    - Check input/output types match
    - Some nodes only accept specific data types
    - Read node documentation for compatibility
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Slow execution">
    - Large batch operations take time
    - Some models are slower than others
    - Check if nodes are running in parallel or sequence
