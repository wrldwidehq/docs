# Workflows

Workflows are the foundation of WRLDWIDE AI. They let you chain AI operations, process content at scale, and automate repetitive tasks — all through a visual interface.

The platform supports two workflow modes: **Dark Factory** for pre-built content pipelines, and the **Node System** for custom workflows.

---

## Workflow Types

### Dark Factory Workflows

Pre-built pipelines optimized for e-commerce content production. Upload a product image and generate a complete content suite automatically.

- Product photography and videos
- UGC-style ads
- Social media kits
- Brand assets

**Best for:** E-commerce brands launching products, creating ad creatives, and scaling content production.

**Access:** [Dark Factory](/dark-factory)

---

### Node System Workflows

Build custom workflows from scratch using 36 node types. Chain AI operations, add conditional logic, and create reusable templates.

- Custom image and video pipelines
- Batch processing
- Conditional branching
- Scheduled automation

**Best for:** Power users building custom pipelines, agencies with specific workflows, and automation scenarios.

**Access:** [Node System](/node-system)

---

## Workflow Lifecycle

1. **Create** — Build or select a workflow
2. **Configure** — Set parameters, inputs, and options
3. **Validate** — Check for errors and missing required fields
4. **Execute** — Run the workflow and monitor progress
5. **Review** — View, download, and share results
6. **Iterate** — Save as template or re-run with modifications

### Starting Points

  <Card title="From Scratch">
    Start with an empty canvas. Add nodes, connect them, and configure each step manually.

### Workflow Components

| Component | Purpose | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **Inputs** | Starting data | Product image, text prompt, video file |
| **Processors** | Transform data | Generate image, remove background, upscale |
| **Logic** | Control flow | If/else conditions, filters, merges |
| **Outputs** | Final results | Downloadable assets, shared posts, scheduled jobs |

---

## Running Workflows

### Execution Modes

**Single Run**
- Process one input through the workflow
- Best for testing and one-off content
- Results appear immediately

**Batch Run**
- Process multiple inputs simultaneously
- Uses List Node or Dark Factory batch mode
- More efficient credit usage
- Progress tracked per item

### Credit Deduction

Credits are deducted as each node executes:

- **Image generation:** 1–4 credits per image
- **Video generation:** 8–24 credits per video
- **Processing:** 1–5 credits per operation
- **Logic nodes:** Free

**Credit calculation:** The workflow shows estimated credits before you run.

### Execution Status

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Queued** | Waiting for resources |
| **Running** | Currently processing |
| **Complete** | Finished successfully |
| **Failed** | Error occurred |
| **Cancelled** | User stopped execution |

---

## Automation

### Cron Scheduling

Schedule workflows to run automatically:

```
[Cron Schedule Node] → [Your Workflow] → [Output/Share]
```

**Common patterns:**
- Daily content generation (0 9 * * *)
- Weekly reports (0 9 * * 1)
- Hourly monitoring (0 * * * *)

**Access:** Add a Cron Schedule Node to any workflow, or use the Schedule tab in Dark Factory.

### Triggers

Future capability (on roadmap): React to events
- New product added to Shopify
- Trending content detected
- Competitor ad spotted

---

## Workflow Patterns

### Pattern: Generate + Enhance

```
[Prompt] → [Generate Image] → [Upscale] → [Export]
```

**Use case:** Create high-quality product images at 4K resolution.

---

### Pattern: Batch Process

```
[List (10 files)] → [Process] → [Export All]
```

**Use case:** Process an entire product catalog automatically.

---

### Pattern: Conditional Route

```
[Input] → [If/Else: Is video?]
        → YES → [Video Processing]
        → NO → [Image Processing]
        → [Merge] → [Export]
```

**Use case:** Handle mixed media inputs with different processing paths.

---

### Pattern: Scheduled Content

```
[Cron: Daily 9am] → [Generate Post] → [Social Share]
```

**Use case:** Auto-generate and post daily social content.

---

## Managing Workflows

### Workspaces

Save workflows as named workspaces:
- Auto-saved drafts
- Named templates
- Shared team workflows
- Marketplace submissions

### Templates

Save successful workflows as templates:
- Name and description
- Default parameters
- Thumbnail preview
- Privacy (private, team, public)

### Versioning

Track changes to workflows:
- Save versions at milestones
- Compare versions
- Revert to previous version
- See edit history

## Best Practices

### Performance

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use List Nodes for Batch">
    Process multiple items in parallel rather than running the workflow multiple times. List nodes are more efficient and cost-effective.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Test Before Scaling">
    Run workflows on 1–3 items before processing 100. Verify outputs match expectations before committing credits to large batches.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Choose the Right Models">
    Don't overpay for quality you don't need. Flux 2 Pro is excellent but costs more credits. Recraft V3 is cheaper and great for many use cases.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cache Intermediate Results">
    If a workflow fails mid-way, cached results let you resume from the last successful node instead of starting over.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Organization

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Name Workflows Clearly">
    Use descriptive names like "Product Photo to 4K Video" instead of "Workflow_v2_final."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Group Related Workflows">
    Organize workspaces into folders: Product Photography, Social Content, Video Ads, etc.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Add Descriptions">
    Document what the workflow does, expected inputs, and typical outputs. Your future self will thank you.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Tags">
    Tag workflows by type, client, or project for easier discovery.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Workflow fails to start">
    - Check all required fields (marked with *) are filled
    - Verify inputs are properly connected
    - Ensure sufficient credits are available
    - Check for circular dependencies in logic nodes
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Results don't match expectations">
    - Review prompt quality — specific prompts yield better results
    - Check model settings — quality tier affects output
    - Verify input data quality — AI outputs depend on input quality
    - Test individual nodes to isolate the issue
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Slow execution">
    - Video generation takes 2–5 minutes per clip
    - Batch processes scale linearly with item count
    - Some models are slower than others (noted in model selectors)
    - Check if running in parallel or sequence
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Credits deducted but no output">
    - Check the execution log for error messages
    - Some processing failures still consume credits (AI provider costs)
    - Contact support with your run ID for credit review
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
